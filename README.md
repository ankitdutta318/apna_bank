This a minor Database Management System Project on Bank Insurance Policies.
It has a very basic log-in and Sign-up page.
There are basicly four basic policies that are offered to the customers. One customer can have n policies on his name.
This project ensures the real time approach of policy management of a bank (for example the need of atleat 2 nominees, etc.)
The front-end is purely hand-crafted and is based on simple HTML 5, CSS 3 and Bootstrap 4.
The tech-stack is composed of PHP, jQuery and MySQL.

This was the brief details about this project. Make sure to give it a Try.
Always open for any suggestion and feedbacks.
Thank You :)
