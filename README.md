This a minor Database Management System Project on Bank Insurance Policies.

It has a very basic log-in and Sign-up page.  
There are basicly four basic policies that are offered to the customers. One customer can have n policies on his name.    
This project ensures the real time approach of policy management of a bank (for example the need of atleat 2 nominees, etc.)  

The front-end is purely hand-crafted and is based on simple  
1. __HTML 5__  
2. __CSS 3__  
3. __Bootstrap 4__  
The tech-stack is composed of  
1. __PHP__  
2. __jQuery__  
3. __MySQL__
